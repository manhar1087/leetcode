Practical 1 integrity checksum
CertUtil -hashfile yourFilepath MD5

Practical 3 packet capture analysis
requirement: wireshark kali VM PCAP file
Steps:
1. Download pcap file
2. open pcap file in VM
3. To analyse statistics tab-> conversations
4. for identifying the ddos attack, packet B->A will be 0(req will no b acknowledged)
5. Alternate method: type"tcp.flags.syn==1&&tcp.flags.ack==0" in filters

Practical 4 Access Control

b. type 'ls -l' to see the images access 
c. chmod u+rwx or g+rwx or o+rwx img.png 

Practical 5 hashing algorithm
practical 6 Encryption
practical 7 stegnography
1. create an image and a text file in the same folder
2. using openstego embed the textfile in the image and save it with a different name
3. a new image is created with hidden embedded text
4. upload the image in openstego and extract it to uncover the hidden text

practical 8 nmap
1. open virtual machine
2. use nmap command to see a list of all the open ports of the website
3. the command nmap -v -sV is used to perform a version detection scan with verbosity in nmap

practical 9
1. use nikto command to perform manual scan
enter ip address on which the scan has to be performed (you can find the ip address of a website by typing ping rapodar.ac.in)
